# BurpAndroidOneLiner

Instead of setting up a burp certificate on Android manually which takes some time, here is a one liner for automating this process.

# Installation
```
  git clone https://github.com/TheSerialiZator/BurpAndroidOneLiner
  
  cd BurpAndroidOneLiner
  
  chmod +x automate.sh
  
  ./automate.sh
 ```
